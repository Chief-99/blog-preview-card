### What I learned

Doing this project I learnt quite a lot about how to do things in a more concise manner. I am hust starting out with HTML and CSS and I definitely still have a lot to learn. I also learnt quite a bit about animations even though I only used one and I am quite proud of it even though it is something simple. It is nice to see progress in your work.


### Continued development

As mentioned previously, I want to improve my mental CSS model. So just the way I think about it as a whole so that I can use it more efficiently and I think the projects offered by this course will help a lot as they will give me quite a bit of practice. I also want to keep on learning more HTML and CSS best practices as I have noticed there are quite a lot. 


### Useful resources

- https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/css-transitions/#the-fundamentals-1 - This article helped me a lot when it came to understanding animations and I will definitely be referring back to it in the future.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_fonts/Variable_fonts_guide - This was recommended to me by someone on the discord server and it helped me understand exactly what variable fonts were and how to use them.
